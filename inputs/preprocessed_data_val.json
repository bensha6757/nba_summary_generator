Allen Crabbe 's 24 points off the bench , with a lights out 9 - of - 11 shooting , proved to be the main difference maker throughout the contest . Across 31 minutes of action , Crabbe simply could not miss , which made up for a still sluggish offensive return from Damian Lillard . The star point guard for the Blazers turned in 14 points , three rebounds and three assists , and continued to defer the scoring to the hot hand of C.J. McCollum . The Blazers shooting guard , who has been averaging over 30 points per game over the last seven contests , added 27 points on 11 - of - 20 shooting . The Cavaliers shot just 34 percent from the field as a unit , and while LeBron James ' box score numbers stood out , the actual game plan seemed to lack communication .

While both teams have already been eliminated from playoff contention , it was still another hard fought game Sunday . Both teams shot very similar percentages , with the Jazz going 46 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three - point line , while the Kings went 48 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep . This marked the fifth straight loss for the Kings , as they look to improve their draft positioning for the 2015 NBA Draft . The Jazz got their biggest offensive contribution from Rodney Hood , who led this team to the close victory . The rookie finished with a team - high of 25 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) , to go along with four steals . He 's only averaging 8 points on the season , but he 's put together two impressive performances in a row , combining for 42 points and five steals . His four steals were also a career - high . While Gordon Hayward struggled to just five points ( 2 - 11 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) , it was Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors who gave Hood the most help . Gobert finished with 10 points ( 5 - 7 FG ) , nine rebounds and two blocked shots , while Favors added 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) and five rebounds of his own . Favors could have put up some higher numbers , but he was limited to just 16 minutes , as he was given a light work load due to the season wearing down and nothing much left to play for . Favors has averaged 16 points and 8 rebounds so far this season , both of which are the best numbers of his five - year career . With Rudy Gay sitting out another game due to suffering a concussion earlier last week , it was Ben McLemore who gave DeMarcus Cousins the most help on the offensive side of the ball . McLemore shot 8 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 20 points , while also contributing five rebounds and four steals . McLemore has struggled with his consistency over the course of this season , so the Kings ' coaching staff would love to see McLemore show some added improvement as the second - year guard 's season comes near to its end . The four steals also matched a season - high for him . Cousins , on the other hand , posted a game - high of 26 points ( 11 - 22 FG , 4 - 9 FT ) , to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists .\n",
